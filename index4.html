          Katherine Johnson was a trailblazing mathematician whose calculations helped send astronauts into space.
          Working at NASA for over 30 years, she played a crucial role in missions including the first American orbital flight.
          She overcame both gender and racial barriers in STEM and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015.
